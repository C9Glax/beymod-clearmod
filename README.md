# Some Caveats:
 This Mod may or may not work depending on your face structure and where the optics sits
i.e.: 
1. if you have a much flatter face, the camera could stick out farther than the cushion could cover and could provide discomfort
2. if your eye is not exactly center from the optic, a small difference makes a big impact on tracking quality
3. it can get hot so prepare some eyedrops if you do wear it for prolonged periods of time.
