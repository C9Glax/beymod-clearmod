Files for ipd ranging from 66-72

If your mm ipd is around 66-72, you might have to experiment a little including swapping out the faceplate cushion and getting some disc magnets thatâ€™s 3x2mm (3mm in diameter, 2mm tall) and super glue to put in place. If you are okay with taking apart your back headset, this is the mod for you.
